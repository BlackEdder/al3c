the al3c example uses "libmacs.cpp" to create a "libmacs.so" file, which in turn invokes the "macs.sh" bash script in this directory.  

macs.sh requires two binaries:

"macs": source code is available from https://github.com/gchen98/macs . Place the "macs" binary in this directory (not to be confused with "libmacs")

"allele_spectrum": compile with the "make" command in this directory
