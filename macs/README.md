the al3c example uses "libmacs.cpp" to create a "libmacs.so" file, which in turn invokes two binaries which should be kept in this directory:

"macs" (not to be confused with "libmacs.so"): source code is available from https://github.com/gchen98/macs . 

"allele_spectrum": compile with the "make" command in this directory
